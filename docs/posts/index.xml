      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Firaaz. I graduated in History last year, but realised I&amp;rsquo;d much rather spend my time looking forward, rather than looking at the past. I promise my programming is less cheesy than that opener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having spent my childhood and teenage years constantly fiddling and experimenting with tech, a lot of the concepts I&amp;rsquo;ve come across during my recent course haven&amp;rsquo;t been entirely unfamiliar - but the depth has, and it&amp;rsquo;s been incredibly refreshing to be able to explore them. When I was younger I often undertook various projects just for fun: learning how to use photoshop, editing Pokemon roms to make my own version with custom sprites, maps, and scripts - even just figuring out how to root my phone was enough to give me that slight dopamine fix that attracts me to the problem-solving nature of programming!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my free time I really enjoy competitive gaming, reading (currently reading Meditations by Marcus Aurelius) and playing guitar, with the eventual goal of making my own music as a hobby. Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;
